Google Yes or No
================

a little script attempting to give you a yes or no answer, using the power of google  

implementation

yesorno.py takes the first result from google for your query and parses that page, counts the occurrences of positive and negative words, then makes a decision based on their ratio.  

Positive words: yes, good, is, will, should, are  
Negative words: no, bad, not, is not, isn't, won't, will not, aren't, are not
